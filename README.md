Wow! Welcome to share-my-toothbrush ðŸª¥ 

This project was to test our coding skills and build our team for another project. But now that you are here, let me take your through!

Share my Toothbush is a plateform where users could share their Toothburshes used or not, you choose. (Nice no?!)

We developped it on Ruby on Rails with the use of Heroku, PostgreSQL and Cloudinary.

Oh you are still there? 

Ok well, as a user here your can either offer your Toothbrush for rent or rent one from another.
